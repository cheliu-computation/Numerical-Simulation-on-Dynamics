# Numerical-Simulation-on-Dynamics

This project is an applicaiton of numerical method on a two-dimensional dynamics problem.
In this project, I simulated the dynamics model and solve it with various numerical method.
Moreover, I did stablity analysis via Lyapunov energy funciton.
Finally, I applied a common algorithm from computer science to accelerate my program.
